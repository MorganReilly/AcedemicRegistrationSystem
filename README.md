# AcedemicRegistrationSystem
System to assign professors to courses, and for students to register to courses.
Genesys Coding Challenge - Morgan Reilly

## Requirements:
* Create an simple API that implements an academic class registration system with REST endpoints that provide the below features. A UI is not needed.
* Create Courses
* Create Professors
* Assign Professors to Courses
* Create Students
* Students register for Courses
* The system should be able to operate over long periods of time â€“ we are looking for design considerations that permit this, not necessarily actual proof.
* The system should be able to scale to 200 requests per second efficiently.
* We should have access to the source code in an online repository
* No restrictions on technologies. AWS technologies would be preferred, but not required.
* Data should be persisted in some form of database.
* We do not expect that you spend more than 8 hours on this challenge, so some rough edges are acceptable.
* Treat this as a proof of concept, so documentation is not important.
* Nice to have - the application should run in the cloud
